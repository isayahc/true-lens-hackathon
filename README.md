## Problem Statement

Creating embeddings for Large Language Model (LLM) retrievers for many developers is a long process of trial and error

## Solution

An agent that is able to configure embeddings. Using [TruEra's Trulens]("https://github.com/truera/trulens") for verification of results and benchmarking

<!-- ## Ideas
### Open Sourced LLM Agents
#### Problem Statement
- Closed sourced LLMs are higher quality, but
  - the data is not private
  - Behavior or models change
#### Solution
- using an agent the help produce better results of open sourced LLM agents -->
